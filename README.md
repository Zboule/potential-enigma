### Tools

#### Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It guarantees good practice in the project creation.

#### Typescript
Instead of javascript, the project is writen with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). One of the biggest advantages of Typescript is its code completion and intelligence. Typescript has the ability to compile down to a version of JavaScript that runs on all browsers.
