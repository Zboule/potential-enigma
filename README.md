## How to start

With node.js installed, in the project folder run commands:

```
npm i
npm run build
npm run serve
```

## Tools used

### React
The selected Framework is React because i'm curently working on a project with it. it's make me more proeficient to realise this project.

### Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It guarantees good practice in the project creation.

### Typescript
Instead of javascript, the project is writen with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). One of the biggest advantages of Typescript is its code completion and intelligence. Typescript has the ability to compile down to a version of JavaScript that runs on all browsers.

### SASS
The style of the project is written with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### UI
To improve development speed some component relies on the UI framework [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)

### Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation.  It makes building UIs organized and efficient.

The storybook of the project can be lunched with:

```
npm run storybook
```




## Architecture
All the components are in src/lib. They have their own stylesheet and their own storybook test. They are build in isolation and have very few dependencies making them easier to test and easier to maintain. Storybook help to enforce this practice.

It was a huge but a cool test project.
